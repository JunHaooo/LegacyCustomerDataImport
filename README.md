# Legacy Customer Data Import System
A production-grade, resilient backend system designed to handle large-scale CSV customer data migrations. Built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, utilizing BullMQ (Redis) for robust asynchronous background processing.

## Quick Start
The entire stack is containerized for a seamless setup.

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JunHaooo/LegacyCustomerDataImport.git
cd LegacyCustomerDataImport
```

Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Launch the application:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The API will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Prerequisites
- Docker (v20.10+)
- Docker Compose (v2.0+)

## API Usage Examples
### 1. Upload CSV Import
`POST /api/imports`

Uploads the CSV file and initiates an asynchronous background job.

```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@./test.csv" http://localhost:3000/api/imports
```

Response (202 Accepted):

```json
{
  "message": "File uploaded and processing started",
  "jobId": "65d8f..."
}
```

### 2. Check Import Status & Results
`GET /api/imports/:id`

Retrieves job metadata, including success/failure counts and specific error messages for rejected rows.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/imports/65d8f...
```

### 3. Customer Management (CRUD)
- List Customers (Paginated): `GET /api/customers?page=1&limit=10`
- Get Customer by ID: `GET /api/customers/:id`
- Update Customer: `PUT /api/customers/:id` (Requires full validation)
- Delete Customer: `DELETE /api/customers/:id`

## Testing
The project includes unit tests for business logic and integration tests for API endpoints using Jest and Supertest.

Run tests with a single command:

```bash
npm test
```

Note: Tests utilize Jest mocks for BullMQ/Redis to ensure isolated, stable execution without environment dependencies.

## Design Decisions
- **Asynchronous Processing (BullMQ/Redis):** To ensure high availability and scalability, CSV parsing is handled out-of-process. This prevents long-running file operations from blocking the API's main thread.
- **Modular MVC Pattern:** Logic is strictly separated into Controllers, Services, and Routes. This enhances maintainability and allows for cleaner unit testing of individual components.
- **Database Integrity:** Implemented Mongoose Unique Indexes on the email field. This provides a second layer of protection against duplicate records beyond application-level checks.
- **Streaming CSV Parser:** Large files are processed using Node.js streams rather than being loaded entirely into memory, allowing the system to handle multi-gigabyte uploads efficiently.
- **Structured Logging:** Utilizes a custom logger to track import job lifecycles, validation failures, and system errors in a consistent JSON-like format.

## 🔍 Assumptions & Limitations
- **CSV Format:** Assumes the first row contains headers: `full_name,email,date_of_birth,timezone`.
- **Duplicate Policy:** If an email already exists in the database, the row is rejected and logged in the `rejectedRecords` array with a detailed error message.
- **Timezone Validation:** Enforces strict IANA timezone validation. Records with non-compliant identifiers will be rejected to ensure downstream data consistency

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- **Multi-file Batch Uploads:** Expand the /api/imports endpoint to support upload.array('files'), allowing users to submit multiple CSVs in a single request for parallel background processing.
- **Batch Database Writes:** Replace individual `.save()` calls with `insertMany()` batches (e.g., every 100 rows) to further optimize database I/O.
- **Real-time Updates:** Integrate WebSockets (Socket.io) to push import progress updates to a frontend dashboard in real-time.
- **Authentication:** Implement JWT-based authentication for the CRUD and Import endpoints for production-level security.
